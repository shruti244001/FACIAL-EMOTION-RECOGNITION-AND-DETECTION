# FACIAL-EMOTION-RECOGNITION-AND-DETECTION
Facial Expression conveys non-verbal cues, which plays important roles in interpersonal relations. The Facial Expression Recognition system is the
process of identifying the emotional state of a person. In this system captured image is compared with the trained dataset available in database
and then emotional state of the image will be displayed. This system is based on image processing and machine learning. For designing a robust
facial feature descriptor, we apply the Local Binary Pattern. Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is a simple yet very efficient texture operator which labels
the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel and considers the result as a binary number. The histogram will be formed by
using the operator label of LBP. The recognition performance of the proposed method will be evaluated by using the trained database with the
help of Support Vector Machine. Experimental results with prototypic expressions show the superiority of the LBP descriptor against some well known appearance-based feature representation methods.
